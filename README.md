Forecasting directional movement in Forex (foreign exchange) data is a challenging task due to the inherent complexity and volatility of the currency markets. Traders and investors need accurate predictions of whether a currency pair will move up or down in order to make informed decisions and maximize profits. Traditional time series forecasting techniques often struggle to capture the nonlinear and dynamic nature of Forex data, making it difficult to achieve reliable predictions.
